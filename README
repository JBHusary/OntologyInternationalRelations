OntologyInternationalRelations
Scope of OntologyInternational Relations is a multi-layered and complex network of relationships between international players.  The primary unit of analysis is the nation state, around which all other aspects of international politics pivot; other actors interact with nation states within the domain of International politics.  The following ontology allows for the organization and extraction about international relationships between different international players, as well as details about structured entity that plays either a direct or indirect role in international politics.  By creating this ontology news services as well as policy makers can store seemingly complex details regarding historical and current and historical international affairs.  

Main Classes and PropertiesThe ontology is broken up into eight main classes, some of which have overlapping subclasses:1.	structuredEntity is used to describe a structuredEntity, ie anything that has an authoritative structure with a governing body.  structuredEntity has two sub-classes: organization and nationState.  Its object properties are isGovernedBy (inverse of governs), connecting each subclass to its sibling class regime; and operatesFromHQ connecting it to HQ, a subclass of place.  nationState is also a subclass of place as well as of internationalPlayer, for reasons that are described below.  a.	Organization has three subclasses: i.	internationalOrg has an object property of hasAsAMember (inverse of isMemberOf) to connect to nationState. International Organizations have only nation states as their members and for this reason make up its own subclass of organization.  They also play a role in international politics and is therefore a subclass of nonStateActor with its sibling, opposition, but unlike its other sibling, nonGovtOrg. 1.	internationalOrg has two subclasses: regional and interestBased; instances of these subclasses are: EuropeanUnion (a regional organization made up of nation states); and OPEC (an interest-based organization regarding oil exportation made up of nation-states).  ii.	nonGovtOrg is used for non-governmental organizations, like the instance AmnestyInternational.  nonGovtOrg are the domain for the object property monitors to regime.  This was done in order to capture the indirect role that non-governmental organizations play in international politics.  The class can be expanded to also give more details about the area in which they are concerned, such as human rights or the environment.    iii.	opposition is the third subclass of organization and is also a subclass of nonStateActor, as is often the case that oppositional structured entities, such as instance PLO, IRA or ISIS, have a direct role in international players, particularly when they are in opposition to a nation state.  opposition is also a subclass of nonStateActor.2.	internationalPlayer is used to signal a structuredEntity that plays a direct role in international politics.  I felt it necessary to make internationalPlayer a separate class than structuredEntity because nonGovtOrg by definition give here, do not play a direct role in international politics and because internationalPlayers have relationships to other classes used to define international politics, which is connected to sibling class relationType through the object property partyTo.  internationalPlayer has two subclasses: nationState and nonStateActor which are disjointed classes; and a class axiom of disjoint union of nationState and nonStateActor.a.	nationState is an intersection of all the classes under which it is a subclass: structuredEntity, place, and internationalPlayer.  b.	nonStateActor can either be an internationalOrg or opposition, both of which are subclasses of organization under main class structuredEntity.  3.	person captures data about individuals.  It has two data properties using string as the data type: wasBorn, isNamed; and an object property holdsPosition to connect it to position for describing the occupation the person holds in a regime. person also has an object property isPartOf to connect it to regime.4.	place describes locations and includes subclasses HQ, city, nationState, and region.  a.	HQ is connected city using object property isLocatedIn; an example is theWhiteHouse.b.	City is connected nationState using object property isLocatedIn and wasRatifiedInCity to treaty; an example is Washington D.C.c.	nationState connects to region using object property isLocatedIn. Examples includes United States, Russia, Franced.	region is also connected to regional (subclass of internationalOrg) using object property basedOnRegion. Examples includes MiddleEast, Europe, theAmericas.5.	position class describes a position, i.e. jobtitle held by a person within a regime.  I made position a class rather than a simple data type so it can be expanded, to include other object and data properties for describing the position. Foreign policy, negotiations, commerce and trade, or intelligence, are all examples of domains in which the position operates and can be made into classes. Examples include UNAmbassador or President.6.	regime describes the administration that governs the structuredEntity.  Data properties of vestedPowerType and cameToPower, using string as the data type, give details about the regime.  regime has an object property of operatesFromHQ to connect it to HQ subclass.  It is also the range for object property monitors.  Instances of regime are Trump Administration and AssadRegime.7.	relationshipType is used to describe the type of relationship that an internationalPlayer will have with another internationalPlayer, and has two subclasses: treaty and conflict.  internationalPlayer is connected to relationshipType through relationshipType using the partyTo object property.  relationshipType also has two data properties: startedOn and isNamed.a.	treaty has two subclasses: multilateral, which involves more than one internationalPlayer, and bilateral, between two parties; it also has a cardinality of having minimum 1 nationState.  Examples include FourthGenevaConvention and OsloAccordsb.	conflict is used for conflicts which become linked to the subclass issue, instances are IrishIndependence and Israeli-Palestinian Issue8.	phenomenon class was selected for lack of a better word.  It aims to describe the different phenomena described in international politics.  It has two subclasses: issue and convention, which are closely related.  a.	issue is a general term and is used to connect to conflict with the object property overIssue.  Often, international conflicts involve similar issues, such as instances independence, nuclearization, and land.  issue was made into a class rather than a literal because of the complexity of the issue and because of how often it may repeat for different conflicts.  b.	Convention is used to describe conventions, such as instances HumanRights or RulesOfWar and are connected to treaty using the object property setsConvention.  PropertiesObject Properties1.	holdsPostion connects domain:person to range:position.

If we think about World War II, many countries were party to the conflict, but some were allied with others and vice versa.  This example demonstrates how limited the use of triplets can be for describing international politics. Despite our ability to use symmetrical features, the connection of ranges to one another was not possible at this level.  .  I opted to create the object property hasRelationshipWith and its subproperties inConflictWith, hasTreatyWith and isAllyOf to try to capture more clearly these relationships.  Unfortunately, they remain separate from either subclass of the relationshipType.  As one observes in the ontology, a player can have a bilateral or a multilateral treaty in one instance and be in conflict with the same player in another.  Similarly, treaty can be connected to its sibling class conflict, using object property createsAgreementToResolve. For this reason, I did not disjoint them.  Similary, internationalPlayer is set to only involve opposition, but more accurately, international politics involves a population, who are represented by that opposition or many oppositions, such as the case of thePalestinians who are usually represented by PLO and/or the State of Palestine, which remains a non State Actor because it is not internationally recognized as a nation state by world powers.  internationalPlayer can also be used to more accurately describe the people or populous.  The structuredEntity class can be expanded to include population or people, though may not be easily connected to other classes, like regime.  Furthermore, there was little to be said about past regimes and their involvement in certain conflicts or relationships.  Overall, this was a useful exercise for thinking about how to visually represent relationships of things and to make often illogical relationships, such as those so often found in the realm of international politics, logical.
